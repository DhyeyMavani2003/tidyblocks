# Example 2.26

We might like to compute the average income per person in the US. To do so, we might first think to take the mean of the per capita incomes across the 3,142 counties in the county data set. What would be a better approach?

Using the email50 data find the mean and standard deviation

# Example 2.33
Consider that the mean family income in the U.S. and standard deviation. How many standard deviations above the mean is an income of $200,000?
