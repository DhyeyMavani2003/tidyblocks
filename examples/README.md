# Examples

This directory contains examples showing how to use [TidyBlocks][tidyblocks] to teach basic data science concepts.
Each example has its own sub-directory containing the files listed below.

1.  `README.md`:
     -   A title.
     -   A brief explanation of the problem being solved.
     -   Any discussion of the solution you think learners or instructors would need.
     -   A citation of the source (e.g., "Question 4.2, CST Exam 2018"). Please provide links to sources where possible.
2.  One or more CSV data files. Use lower-case hyphenated names, e.g., `song-preferences.csv` rather than `DATA.CSV`.
3.  One or more saved workspaces with lower-case hyphenated names.
4.  An SVG screenshot of each workspace.

If the example has several parts that build on each other, please create a sub-heading for each (e.g., `## Part 1`, `## Part 2`, etc.) and include a workspace and screenshot for each.

Please submit each example as a separate pull request.
